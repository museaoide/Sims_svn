#' Priors for time series regression
#' 
#'     Creates dummy observations for a prior symmetric in variables, 
#'     favoring persistence.
#' 
#'     The regression right-hand-side is assumed to contain lagged values, possibly
#'     of both dependent and independent variables.  By default it centers on a 
#'     random walk with no effects of independent variables. The results can be used
#'     directly in \code{\link{blm}}
#'
#'    @param  vlist Character vector of names of the rhs variables
#'    @param  dvname Name of dependent variable
#'    @param  lags How many lags of each variable.  Can be a single integer, 
#'            if all variables appear with the same number of lags, or a 
#'            vector of integers, one for each variable. Note that this 
#'            program does not care whether, when \code{lags[iv]=3}, this means that
#'            lags 1 to 3, 0 to 2, or 10 to 12 are included.  
#'    @param  scale A vector, of the length of \code{vlist} plus 1, of 
#'            reasonable guesses as to the standard deviations of 
#'            the variables.  The last element scales the levels dummy that relates the constant to the
#'            other parameters, which should be 1.0, or smaller if guesses of variable means in vmeans are
#'            quite uncertain.
#'   @param   bbar mean of the regression coefficient vector.  Default of 1 
#'            followed by zeros is reasonable when the first variable is a lagged dependent variable and this
#'            is a regression with a persistent dependent variable.  Last element
#'            is prior mean of constant (usually 0).
#'   @param   smooth The rate at which the scale of dummy observations drops as we go from low to
#'            high frequencies.  Should usually be in (0,1).  If close to zero, prior on the 
#'            variable's effect is stronger at low than at high frequencies.  With smooth=1
#'            and damp=1, the prior just shrinks all coefficients toward their prior means
#'            symmetrically and independently.
#'   @param   damp The rate at which the dummy observations increase with increasing lag length. Should
#'            equal or exceed one if distant lags are more likely to be large than near-in lags.
#'   @param   erratio ratio of error variance from parameter uncertainty to error variance from the
#'            residual for the first sample observation. Keeping this constant across models of
#'            different size avoids a prior that implies big models should fit much better.
#'   @param   vmeans A priori means for the variables.  They are used in forming the last dummy observation,
#'            connecting the constant to the other coefficients.  Could be set as sample means of initial conditions.
#'            Using full sample means is problematic: the contamination of prior by data may not be a big
#'            problem for stationary data, but could be substantially distorting for non-stationary data.
#'   @return  A list with components:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item y. Dependent variable value for dummy observations.
#'     \item X. Dummy observations implementing the prior.  
#'     \item scalefac. Amount by which the prior has been scaled to match \code{erratio}.
#'   }
#'   @details Note that the last column of \code{X} is the
#'            "constant", which will *not* be a column of ones.  Generating the sample
#'            \code{X} matrix using \code{lagts()} will not by itself create a constant term in the last column.
#'            \code{lagts()} does put the variables and lags in the same order as this function.  But you have
#'            to tack on the constant vector with \code{cbind()}.  \code{X} is a matrix with column names
#'            constructed from \code{vnames} (repeated for lags).  Note that \code{lagts()} allows non-sequential lists
#'            of lags.  This program allows different lag lengths, but always \code{1:lag[iv]}.
#'  @seealso \code{\link{lagts}} for preparation of a data matrix in a form that is compatible with this
#'           function.  \code{\link{blm}} to combine the prior with data to obtain estimates.
