If we draw Sigma from the r.f. posterior, then take one
Taylor-expansion step away from the MLE for A toward a solution of
A'A=Sigma, the resulting draw for A is a linear function of Sigma. We
have the Inverse-Wishart density for Sigma, and since the mapping from
Sigma to the A draw is a fixed linear function, the Sigma density is
proportional to the correct density for the A draws.  So we have the
ingredients for a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, without having to do any
iterative equation solving or maximization at each draw.

The linear system to solve is 

((I %x% t(Ahat)) + (t(Ahat) %x% I) %*% P) vec(A - Ahat) = Sigdraw - Sighat,

where P is the matrix such that P %*% vec(A) = vec(t(A)).  Since A has
zeros in it (or is otherwise a linear function of a smaller number of
parameters than there are elements in the matrix) some columns of the
big l.h.s. matrix are not used, and some rows therefore become
redundant.  Solution by qr.solve should therefore be used.  The matrix
should be inverted once, at the start, since the inverse will be
re-used on every draw.
