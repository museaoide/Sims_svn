### ydata:        endogenous variable data matrix, including initial condition dates.
### xdata:        exogenous variable data matrix, including initial condition dates.  
### const:        Constant term is added automatically if const=TRUE.
### breaks:       breaks in the data.  The first lags data points after a break are used
###               as new initial conditions, not data points for the fit.
### lambda:       weight on the co-persistence prior dummy observation.  (5 is reasonable)
###               lambda>0 => x variables included; lambda<0 => x variables excluded;
### mu:           weight on variable-by-variable sum of coeffs dummy obs. (1 is reasonable)
### mnprior$tight:weight on the Minnesota prior dummies.  Prior std dev on first lag is
###               1/mnprior$tight
### mnprior$decay:prior std dev on own lag j is 1/j^decay
### vprior$sig:   vector of nv prior std dev''s of equation shocks.  vprior$sig is needed
###               to scale other components of the prior, even if vprior$w=0. Not needed for a pure training
###               sample prior.
### vprior$w:     weight on vcv dummies.  (1 is reasonable; higher values tighten up.)
### train:        If non-zero, this is the point in the sample at which the
###               "training sample" ends.  Prior x likelihood to this point is weighted to
###               integrate to 1, and therefore is treated as if it were itself the prior.
###               To do a pure training sample prior, set lambda=mu=0, mnprior=NULL, vprior$w=0,
###               train>lags.  
### flat:         Even with lambda=mu=vprior$w=0, mnprior=NULL, det(Sigma)^(-(nv+1)/2) is used
###               as a "prior", unless flat=TRUE. flat=TRUE is likely not to work unless train is reasonably large.
### nonorm:       If true, use dummy observations but do not normalize posterior to make them a
###               proper prior.  Useful to duplicate results obtained by others, to use
###               dummy observations that do not imply a proper prior, or to save computing time in case only the
###               posterior on this model's parameters, not the weight on the model, is needed.  
### ic:           Initial conditions matrix for use in forming the sums of coefficients dummy observations.
###               If ic=NULL, the means of the first lags observations in ydata are used.  If !is.null(ic),
###               ic should be a single "observation" on the y's and x's that will be used as the persistent
###               values entering the sums of coefficients dummies.
###
###               Note that to enter a prior directly as dummy observations, one can treat the
###               Dummy observations as a training sample.
