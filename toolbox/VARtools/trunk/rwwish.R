  ## v:  degrees of freedom for the Wishart
  ## S:  Scale matrix for the Wishart
  ## n:  number of draws needed
  ## value:  a pxpxn array of n draws that are Cholesky square roots of Wisharts.
  ## The routine could easily be modified (as shown below) to deliver Wisharts
  ## instead of their square roots, but for simulation purposes usually the square
  ## roots are more useful, and the user can add the line of code to convert after
  ## the call in any case.
  ##
  ## This is much more efficient than the original MCMCpack rwish when multiple
  ## draws are to be made.  about 20 times faster for 4x4 S with n=200, e.g.
  ## Because this is based on
  ## MCMCpack code, it is covered by the GPL, version 2, which is available with
  ## every R installation.
