Description: Finds unstable and stable roots, imposes restrictions to suppress
  the unstable ones.  Checks whether the restrictions are consistent with the
  free expectational error terms (existence) and whether all the expectational
  error terms are determined (uniqueness).  Also reads in a nonlinear equation 
  system given as R expressions, to form an eqsys object, automatically 
  differentiates it.
